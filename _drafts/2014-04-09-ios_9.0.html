          <h1>Gaia GPS iOS v9.0</h1>
          
          <p>With Gaia 9, we'd like to welcome all Gaia users to a new era of maps.</p>

          <p>This update includes a blazing fast vector topo maps engine, that works offline and on, provides coverage worldwide, and brings a range of benefits, from vastly decreased download sizes, to amazing readability at any zoom level.</p>

          <p>Besides the vector capabilities, the new engine will display all of the existing maps at much higher speed - in fact, we don't think they can get any faster. At 60 frames per second, the map display now rivals any high-performance video game.</p>
          
          <p>Gaia GPS 9 brings us into the era of the living map - this is a map that changes every minute, impacted by your footsteps and the footsteps of those like you.</p>
          
          <p>The map incorporates weekly updates of OpenStreetMap data, weekly updates from our Places crawler that finds reports from around the internet, and daily updated GaiaCloud tracks.
          
          <p>It's a new kind of map, and more, in Gaia 9:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>vector topo maps</li>
            <li>extremely fast display of all maps, raster and vector</li>
            <li>all new routing and distance measuring interface</li>
            <li>options to show track recorder and photo button on main map</li>
            <li>display public GaiaCloud tracks from other users on the map</li>
            <li>POI data and related reports have been updated and greatly expanded (clear cache in Settings)</li>
          </ul>
