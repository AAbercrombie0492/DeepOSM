# Gaia GPS iOS v10.0.1

* The biggest feedback we received on the new folders in 10.0 was that you wanted tracks to not show in the tracks list if you put them in a folder. So now they don't. This can be toggled by tapping the action button in the upper right corner of the saved screen.
* The Apple Watch isn't even out yet, and we're already making Gaia GPS on the Watch better. This version adds a Glance.
* Fixed a bug where the stats at the bottom of the map could not be changed.
* Importing files wasn't working correctly in 10.0. Sorry. We fixed it.
* Fixed several bugs that were causing crashes in the grid view.
