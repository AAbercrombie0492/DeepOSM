# Gaia GPS iOS v10.1

* Fixes a bug that was causing GPS to not be turned off after looking at map on watch.
* Automatic syncing every time you connect to network.
* Fixed several bugs related to purchasing subscriptions.
* Improved formatting for exported routes.
* Fixed a bug that was causing some imported tracks and routes to show a distance of 0.
* Andrew can see everything you do in the app, but it's not creepy, trust me.
* Timeline view doesn't show months with no data.
* Saved screens now use Grid mode by default, but you can switch it to list mode in settings.
