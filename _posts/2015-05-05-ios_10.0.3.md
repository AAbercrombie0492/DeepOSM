# Gaia GPS iOS v10.0.3

* This version fixes a serious bug with the track recorder where track points could sometimes be lost.
* The Apple Watch interface has been redesigned: it now uses a page based layout, and isn't as confusing.
* Clearing the cache now also deletes track and waypoint thumbnails.
