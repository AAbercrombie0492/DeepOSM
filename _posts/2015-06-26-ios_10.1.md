# Gaia GPS iOS v10.1

BUG NOTICE
We introduced a bug in this version. If you name a Map when you download it, the app crashes. You can work around this issue by not naming the map when you save it. You can later name the Map from the Details screen. If the crash occurs, it will create a bad map stub, which should just be deleted. 

We will have a fix posted to Apple asap - it may take until next week to be live, because of review times. We're sorry for the issue.

* Automatic syncing when you are connected to the internet.
* Saved screens now use Grid mode by default, and you can switch it to list mode in Settings.
* Timeline view doesn't show months with no data.
* Fixed a bug that was causing some imported tracks and routes to show a distance of 0.
* Improved formatting for exported routes.
* Apple Watch - Fixes a bug that was causing GPS to not be turned off after looking at map on watch.
* Fixed several bugs related to purchasing subscriptions.
* Added better analytics for app improvement and customer support.
