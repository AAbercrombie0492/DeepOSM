# Skipper v3.0

In Skipper 3.0, we totally changed how the free version works. We abolished the "Trial Mode," and now most Skipper features work even if you don't subscribe. 

Now, the free version of Skipper lets you browse charts online, make routes, record trips, and more. This is much more complete than the simple chart viewer offered for free before. The subscription gives you the following capabilities:

* download charts for offline use
* keep charts automatically up-to-date
* download other map sources for offline use
* use ActiveCaptain data and features
