# Gaia GPS iOS v10.4 (beta)

This update adds features, improves the UI, and squashes bugs a plenty.

 * auto-naming - tracks, routes, waypoints, and photos are automatically named based on where they occurred - mo more "My Track" and "My Photo" default names

 * new Pro feature - draw areas, measure area and perimeters, download maps based on areas

 * new left menu - on iPhone, left menu now uses the grid, better emphasizes important choices, and is easier to use one-handed

 * new Map Sources screen - the screen where you add/remove Map Sources has been improved, and you can now view details about map sources in the app

 * remove default sources - you can now remove even default sources the app starts with, and customize your map layers perfectly

 * better custom map source handling - view/add/remove sources you imported via the new Map Sources screen too

 * of all the unlikely crashes in Gaia GPS, this release should fix about half of them, and we expect what was once a stable app, is now even stabler

 * re-edited localization for all languages, added Turkish translation

 * fixed a bug where after guiding, stats on the map were laid out badly
