# Gaia GPS iOS v10.4.1

This update addresses bugs in the major 10.4 release ([see 10.4 release notes http://updates.gaiagps.com/ios/ios_10.4.html](http://updates.gaiagps.com/ios/ios_10.4.html)).
* Images exported by zip and email now have filenames based on date-time, and are unqiue.
* Fixed a crash after stopping recording on iPad.
* Fixed issue with grid labels being under toolbar, or not showing at all.
* Fixed some map sources not staying removed on app restart.
* Saved menu on iPad GaiaPro did not have an option so view Areas, and now it does.
* Fixed a crash when toggling automatic publishing of tracks.
* Fixed a crash when using Airplay with the zoom label turned on.
* Fixed airplay not activating properly when launching the app, when already connected to an external display.
* The left menu was distorted under iOS 7. It looks much better now.
