# Gaia GPS iOS v10.4.1 (beta)

This update is all bug fixes.
* Fixed a crash after stopping recording on iPad.
* Fixed grid labels being under toolbar, or not showing at all.
* Sometimes map sources didn't want to stay removed, now they will.
* Saved menu on iPad did not have an option so view Areas, now it does.
* Images exported in a zip file all had the same name, that didn't really work, now they are named by date.
* Fixed a crash when toggling automatic publishing of tracks.
* Fixed a crash when using Airplay with the zoom label turned on.
* Airplay was not activating properly when launching the app when already connected to an external display, that's fixed.
* The left menu was all messed up under iOS 7. It looks much better now.
