# Offline Topo Maps iOS v6.1

This update does it all: adds features, improves the UI, and fixes bugs.

* Improved Left Menu on iPhone (not iPad)
* 3D-Touch support - On the map, and saved screens.
* of all the unlikely crashes in Offline Topo Maps, this release should fix about half of them, and we expect what was once a stable app, is now even stabler

## Map Source Menus
* the menus where you choose map sources and add map sources have been improved
* map sources in your list now use an icon based on the exact map - different for each
* you can now view a details screen about map sources in the app - includes a demo map, zoom range, description, and attribution
* added a description for each map source - have fun browsing tons of maps of the world and history
* remove default sources - you can now remove even default sources the app starts with, and customize your map layers perfectly (many people have requested this)
* manage imported sources - view/add/remove sources you imported via the Add Map Sources screen too

## Localization
* re-did localization for all languages, added Turkish translation
