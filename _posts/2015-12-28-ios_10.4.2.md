# Gaia GPS iOS v10.4.2

This update addresses bugs in the major 10.4 release ([see 10.4 release notes http://updates.gaiagps.com/ios/ios_10.4.html](http://updates.gaiagps.com/ios/ios_10.4.html)).

* Order of sources in map menu is now sorted alphabetically.
* Fixed issue where tapping on a cluster of markers where all markers are in the exact same location would cause the map to zoom out instead of in.
* Fixed crash when downloading maps with an Airplay display connected.
* Fixed custom title getting overridden by automatic naming when creating waypoints.
* Areas are now listed on Folder details screens.
