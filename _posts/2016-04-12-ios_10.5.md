# Gaia GPS iOS v10.5

 * enables HD maps - NOTE: this change won't be available until about 1 week after this update going live, because we need to wait for the majority of people to update - see blog.gaiagps.com for more info

 * HD map info - when this goes live in about a week, you'll be able to add HD versions OpenHikingMap, OpenCycleMap, and some other map sources (these maps display much better, with bigger text, on retina screens)

 * if you sync a shared Map from gaiagps.com now, it will add the map source if you don't have it yet (before you had to manually add the source)
