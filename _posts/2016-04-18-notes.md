I decided to start journaling because I have a bit of traction, and the analysis isn't totally wrong. Also Lacker said I should have a notebook, but I mever write stuff with pens.

# Data Science

* Ran 5000 training batches last night over night, noticed the data wasn't being properly randomized. 

* Fixed it, ran a new 50 batches. Not very accurate at that level of training, 50/50. 

* Ran a new test of 500 batches. 52% accurate.

* Ran a new test of 500 batches with a bigger patch (8px patch instead of 6px). Only 48% accurate, and only predicted 8.5% of test set on.

* Ran a new test of 500 batches with a bigger patch (7px patch). 

# Programming

 * fix a bug in data randomization
 * added todos list 
 * added project journal using github pages
