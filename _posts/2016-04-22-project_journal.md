## Data Science

* limiting to 2-lane + roads not effective

* 52.5% with 40px, limiting to: 'primary', 'secondary', 'tertiary', 'trunk'

* (56% with 300 batches) now trying larger tiles (56px) limiting to: 'primary', 'secondary', 'tertiary', 'trunk' 

* (70% with 7000 batches) now trying 64px, limiting to: 'primary', 'secondary', 'tertiary', 'trunk' 


Going to fatten the roads and get more NAIPs next, then more work on the CNN.
