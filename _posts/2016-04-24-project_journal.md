## Data Science

* 6000 batches, 64% accuracy, any highway, 64px
* 9000 batches, 70% accuracy, any highway, 64px

## Coding

* got s3cmd set up, to list the NAIP bucket (to grab random NAIPs, instead of hard-coded values)
* script now grabs 4 randomish maryland NAIPs, instead of the same 4 around DC each time (let's see how much the accuracy varies)
* made code/README more accessible, removed Experiment 1
